Although I dabbled in various other roles, backend development always felt like my true calling. Interestingly, I began working with data engineering tasks before I even knew the term existed. My official transition to data engineering occurred while I was a Senior Software Engineer at a Silicon Valley company called Nextroll.<br><br>Our team at Nextroll had minimal "typical" backend work. We mostly fixed each other's bugs or added minor features. However, a sudden influx of data engineering tasks led our entire backend team to shift focus. For over a year, I performed data engineering duties without holding the official title.<br><br>Backend engineering started to feel monotonous to me. While scaling a product for a billion users in a cost-effective and resilient manner is undoubtedly cool and challenging, such opportunities are rare. I realized that data and AI represent the future. Data engineering seemed like the perfect avenue to combine my passion for backend development with a role more resilient to future changes. I am optimistic about AI's potential in the next decade, and I believe backend roles may become more specialized and automated. In contrast, data engineering is a field where ten different people might give you ten different definitions.</p><p>Nextroll faced tough times due to the deprecation of third-party cookies in Chrome, which led to many layoffs, including mine. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to officially switch to a data engineering role. Currently, I work remotely for a company that allows me to support BP (British Petroleum). Remote work is crucial for me.<br><br><b>Why am I, a relatively new data engineer, the right person to guide you?</b><br><br>I bring a unique perspective. Having worked in various environments and roles, I can view data engineering from a broader angle that many seasoned data engineers might not. I consider myself a competent programmer with a solid understanding of fundamental computer science principles and Python.<br><br>I know self-promotion can be off-putting, but it's essential for you to trust me as we embark on this journey together. <em>Shall we begin?</em></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 11, 2024</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://kherashanu.com/tags/apache-spark/">Apache Spark</a></li><li><a href="https://kherashanu.com/tags/data-engineering/">Data Engineering</a></li><li><a href="https://kherashanu.com/tags/pyspark/">PySpark</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkherashanu.com%2Fpyspark-for-everyone-part-0-why-me.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kherashanu.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkherashanu.com%2Fpyspark-for-everyone-part-0-why-me.html&amp;via=%40kherashanu&amp;text=PySpark%20for%20Everyone%20-%20Part%200%3A%20Why%20Me%3F" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kherashanu.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkherashanu.com%2Fpyspark-for-everyone-part-0-why-me.html" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kherashanu.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=PySpark%20for%20Everyone%20-%20Part%200%3A%20Why%20Me%3F https%3A%2F%2Fkherashanu.com%2Fpyspark-for-everyone-part-0-why-me.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with Whats App" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kherashanu.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://kherashanu.com/media/website/profile.jpeg" loading="eager" height="460" width="460" alt="khera shanu"><div><h3><a href="https://kherashanu.com/authors/khera-shanu/" class="inverse" title="khera shanu">khera shanu</a></h3><p>Hi, I’m Shanu Khera, a seasoned software and data engineer with over a decade of experience in architecting scalable systems and data pipelines.
